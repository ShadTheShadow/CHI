                        Prior to CHI, I was a youth leader in my youth group at

                        member of the National Honor Society. I am an active

                        want to serve the homeless to follow the example of
                        Jesus Christ, and to carry out his mission of serving
                        the poor. I work at an assisted living facility, serving
                        the elderly in my community. I feel for the senior
                        citizens struggling out in the streets, and want to help
                        them like I do at my job.I wanted to be a part of CHI so
                        that I could serve the poor in my community. I wanted to
                        be a part of a group that helped those in need.After
                        high school I plan on attending the University of St.
                        Thomas in order to study Philosophy, Catholic Studies,
                        psychology, and Spanish.

                  Prior to CHI, I was a youth leader in my youth group at St.
                  Pius X, a member of the Knights of Columbus, and a member of
                  the National Honor Society. I am an active leader in my
                  church, helping to lead religious events. I want to serve the
                  homeless to follow the example of Jesus Christ, and to carry
                  out his mission of serving the poor. I work at an assisted
                  living facility, serving the elderly in my community. I feel
                  for the senior citizens struggling out in the streets, and
                  want to help them like I do at my job.

                  I wanted to be a part of CHI so that I could serve the poor in
                  my community. I wanted to be a part of a group that helped
                  those in need.
